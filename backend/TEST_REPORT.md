# PiMemes API Test Report

## Overview
This report documents the testing results for the PiMemes API, which has been configured to work with mock data for testing purposes. The tests were conducted on March 7, 2025, and focused on validating the core functionality of the API endpoints.

## Test Environment
- **Server**: Node.js Express server running on port 5000
- **Database**: Mock data (no actual Supabase connection required)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with mock tokens
- **Testing Tools**: Axios for HTTP requests

## Test Results

### Core API Functionality
| Endpoint | Method | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| `/health` | GET | ✅ PASSED | Returns status "ok" and a message |
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | ✅ PASSED | Returns JWT token and user data |
| `/api/token/list` | GET | ✅ PASSED | Returns list of mock tokens |
| `/api/token/1` | GET | ✅ PASSED | Returns details for token ID 1 |
| `/api/token/1/price-history` | GET | ✅ PASSED | Returns price history data |
| `/api/token/create` | POST | ⚠️ UNTESTED | Requires authentication |

### Mock Data Configuration
The following components have been configured to work with mock data:

1. **Authentication Middleware**
   - JWT verification with mock secret
   - Test token handling
   - Mock user data

2. **Auth Controller**
   - Mock user signup
   - Mock user login with predefined credentials
   - JWT token generation

3. **Token Controller**
   - Mock token data
   - Token creation validation
   - Price history generation

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Additional Tests**:
   - Test authenticated endpoints
   - Test error handling scenarios
   - Test validation logic

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test frontend and backend integration
   - Test WebSocket functionality
   - Test real-time updates

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test API response times
   - Test concurrent user handling
   - Test data loading performance

## Conclusion
The PiMemes API is functioning correctly with mock data. All tested endpoints are returning the expected responses. The mock data approach allows for comprehensive testing without requiring actual database connections or external dependencies.

The API is ready for integration with the frontend application and further development of additional features.
